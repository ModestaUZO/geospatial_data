# geospatial_data

Welcome to my project, a comprehensive exploration of geospatial data visualization using Folium, a Python library specifically tailored for this purpose. In this project, I have embarked on a captivating journey of map creation with a dual focus.


The first part of the project takes us to the bustling streets of San Francisco, where we dive into the visualization of local crime data. Through Folium, I have plotted crime incidents on an interactive map, enabling us to identify crime hotspots, patterns, and trends within the city.

The second part of this project is dedicated to understanding and visualizing international immigration to Canada from various countries. Using Folium, I have created interactive maps, including a choropleth map, to provide a deeper insight into immigration trends. This allows us to gain a better understanding of the origins of immigrants and their distribution across Canada.
